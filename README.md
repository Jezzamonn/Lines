# ES6 Base
Base project for creating interactive things ES6 JavaScript. :)

It creates a full-page canvas, which you draw on with JavaScript. There's a rough framework for handling resizing/animation timing already so that in the Controller.js class you can just implement `update()` and `render(context)` and it should do stuff for you.

## Getting Started
`npm install` in the main directory will install dependencies.

## Building Stuff
To build everything manually you can use `npm run webpack`.

## Running local webserver
`npm start`
This brings up a local webserver from which you can view your changes in a browser. You can also check it out on a phone through clever networking stuff (i.e. being on the same wifi network and finding your computer's local IP address)

## Automatically Build & Refresh
For a smoother dev flow, building stuff can be done *automatically*! Cool!

The following command will check for any files changing and will rebuild everything:
`npm run watch`

To then get the page to automatically reload on change, instead of using `npm start` you can use:
`npm run reload`

---

My usual workflow is to have three terminal windows open, one for running the server, one for automatically updating and one for miscellaneous commands.
